A personal retrospective of 2023
{{< /tldr >}}


# 2023 was a shit year
I usually enjoy doing these yearly posts,
looking back at what I did and planning what I'll do,
but 2023 was a shit year.
Fuck 2023.

# Took trainings
In France,
when working for the private sector,
you get money poured yearly in a fund for training in case you want to learn new skills.
This fund is capped and I had never used it since I began working,
which means that every year I was actually losing 500EUR of funding.
I was still taxed for it,
so I decided to take some trainings and make good use of that money.

I really wanted to learn about music production and VR,
so I submitted a request for a training in music production and...
supposedly VR development which turned out to be 3d modeling because it's ok to mislabel trainings I guess :-)


## Music production
I did 2.5 weeks of music production training,
full time,
and it was really awesome.
I learnt a lot of theory,
had a lot of practice,
got daily assignments and got to share with professional musicians on various topics.

I can't possibly sum up all I learnt,
it's unvaluable,
but I feel like it's the best training I ever had in my life after my training in hypnosis.

As these funded trainings are certified,
I eventually had to make an original production and a remix for an evaluation by a jury,
and while it was tough due to the very short time I had to do it,
I managed to do both and get certified.

## 3d modeling with Unity
I did 2 weeks of 3d modeling training with Unity,
where I basically had two hours of training conducted by a trainer each morning,
then had to organize my own work so I could complete the daily assignments.
I couldn't take time off work for this training,
so I mostly worked on the evenings and nights which led to a lot of sleep deprivation.

The training was ok,
I learnt a lot of things,
but quite frankly I didn't enjoy it as much as the music production training,
mostly because the training was supposed to be about VR development...
and it wasn't.
I was still interested in the topic of 3d modeling,
but I felt like I was misled and the only real benefit was that I got to learn how to use Unity.

I did a TON of modelings like these:

A bit or augmented reality,
like floating a cube over my coffee mug:

but I didn't really get to do any VR development which is a shame.

This training was also certified,
I had to take a timed exam to model a scene and then present it to a jury,
which I did and got certified.


# Wrote a ton of code
I wrote a ton of code.

I can't even remember all the things I did this year,
but I wrote a lot of code,
that's for sure.

I worked a lot on my plakar project,
I worked on improving the FastCDC chunker implementation,
I worked on implementing the UltraCDC chunker algorithm.
I wrote a set theory database PoC,
a PoC for an interpreted language...
which I then wrote a compiler and VM for.
I wrote a music language (earmuff) and an interpreter for it,
then an AI-powered music assistant that could plug into a DAW and generate MIDI.
I wrote a MIDI software router.
I wrote a PoC for a decentralized twitter alternative.
I wrote the first bricks of a Golang MTA.

That's just the things I can remember.

I kept my mind busy as much as I could,
I didn't want to think about anything else.


# Failed to build a guitar
I wanted to build a guitar,
tried and failed.

It looked nice:

It sounded shit and eventually the string tension broke the neck.


# Put arabic learning on hold
I had to put arabic learning on hold as I lost my arabic teacher,
and couldn't find anyone serious for that dialect.

ma fi mechkle,
ra7 camel t3alam la 7ale ma3 netflix w chatGPT.

Hopefully I can make progress on my own.


# Put my hypnotherapy business on (permanent ?) hold
After we lost our baby,
I put my hypnotherapy business on temporary hold so I could mourn,
take some time to focus on my family and recover.

I was supposed to reopen late 2023,
but I realised I want a longer break and am no longer so much invested in helping others.
I've spent 7 years doing and studying hypnotherapy,
it is one of the best skill I learnt in my life,
but these last years I've only focused on using it for others and not for myself.

I know hypnosis will remain a big part of my life as it has changed it for the best,
but I don't know if I'll ever do hypnotherapy again,
time will tell.


# Taught Python/OOP to students
I was offered to teach Python and OOP to students at a local school,
and I accepted because I wanted to keep my mind busy and I like teaching.


# How's 2024 going to be ?
I don't know what 2024 will be made of,
can't possibly be worse than 2023,
but I'm not expecting much really.

I intend to take care of my son the best I can,
continue learning new skills,
continue writing code,
and definitely not build a new guitar.

I picked an interest in ARM64 assembly,
I might do something with that.
I also want to learn more about music theory and composition,
and I want to learn more about VR development.

I hope 2024 will be a good year.
